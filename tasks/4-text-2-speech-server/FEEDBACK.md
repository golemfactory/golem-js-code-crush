### Feedback:
Please provide any feedback you have regarding each task step below:

#### Step 1: Create a script that will start HTTP server on port 3000

Overall creating a basic http server is very simple task. For experienced javascript developers this is a second hand nature job. However still, error handling must be incorporated to make the code more robust.

#### Step 2: Create a `/tts` endpoint that accepts `q` query param with input text

Consequent to Step.1 this is also basic task in server and API development. While performing this task I didn't have to make a lot of effort as the framework I chose provides a very robust api for creating endpoints and managing query parameters.

#### Step 3: Schedule task with received text to be converted on Golem Network

The documentation had some good examples to illustrate this task so following that wasn't much of a problem. In my task I built and deployed a custom vm from a docker image and deployed on the Golem Network (**id: 1e88943d64a9175ab9855ebb2d628b4728b6656b2730541899d15b63**). This step went pretty smooth and I didn't face lot of difficulty in this task.

#### Step 4: Scale number of contracted providers as more requests are received
Now comes the interesting part. While doing this step I went through the Golem Network and JS API docs available at https://handbook.golem.network/ to search for any possible clue. While the documentation is written in a good style, I felt that documentation is not serving it's purpose i.e to TEACH how to make great applicaitons / products utilizing the strengths of Golem Network. Below are some of the points I noticed about documentation.
  *  Firstly the docs are very disorganized.
