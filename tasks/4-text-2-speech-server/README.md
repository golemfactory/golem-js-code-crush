# Task #4 - Text2Speech Server

Thank you for your interest in the JS Preview Program. Its purpose is to test the new JS API and the new documentation 
available at https://docs.golem.network/creators/. This is where you should find all the necessary information about 
Golem Network needed to complete this task. 

If you have any questions, we encourage you to contact the SDK team directly, who can help you identify any gaps 
in the documentation or fill in any gaps in your knowledge about the Golem Network platform - join our community on 
[Discord](https://chat.golem.network/) - find the `#js-discussion` channel in the SDK section. 

We also encourage you to visit https://www.golem.network/, where you can find more basic information about our open-source project.

## Task Details

### Why:
Since managing providers and pooling resources is an important part of Golem’s higher-scale deployment, 
demonstrating these aspects in this task supports our vision to utilise the Network’s capabilities to the fullest extent.

### Description:
Prepare for a bigger scale and allow any user to interact with your API. 
This will serve as a gateway that schedules tasks on Golem and forwards the results. 

First, create a REST API in Node.js that allows the user to send a request with a text as input, which will be sent to 
a provider together with a payload containing ready-to-use tools for text2speech generation already installed. 
Once the generation is complete, an audio file is sent back to the user.

The main difference between the previous Text2Speech task is that this involves setting up a pool of active agreements 
with providers where the conversion is executed. 
This allows the REST API to respond more quickly to new requests.

### Steps:

1. Implement a `start` command in the package.json file to start the server on port 3000
2. Create a REST API application exposing a single GET endpoint `/tts` accepting `q` query argument with text to be converted to speech
3. Schedule text-to-speech conversion on Golem (as described in the other Text2Speech task).
4. The number of contracted providers scales when the endpoint receives more requests, so text-to-speech conversion happens in parallel
5. [Fill out the feedback form](./FEEDBACK.md) and publish changes in your repository fork

**What is the Golem Network?**

We are building a new open-source world that everyone has the right to enter. 
The Golem Network is a flexible and open-source platform that harnesses the power of decentralization for 
accessing and sharing computational resources.

**Our new Golem JS Api lets you:**

- Develop distributed open-source computing solutions for a wide range of use cases
- Run tasks on the Golem Network directly from your browser
- Create serverless applications using Golem as your computation backend

With your feedback, our open-source platform, the Golem Network, will become even more attractive to other developers! 

**Thank you!**
