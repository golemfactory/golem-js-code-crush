# Task #1 - Text2Speech

Thank you for your interest in the JS Preview Program. Its purpose is to test the new JS API and the new documentation 
available at https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/. This is where you should find all the necessary information about 
Golem Network needed to complete this task. 

If you have any questions, we encourage you to contact the SDK team directly, who can help you identify any gaps 
in the documentation or fill in any gaps in your knowledge about the Golem Network platform - join our community on 
[Discord](https://chat.golem.network/) - find the `#js-discussion` channel in the SDK section. 

We also encourage you to visit https://www.golem.network/, where you can find more basic information about our open-source project.

## Task Details


### Why

There are many great tools for text2speech generation, but setting them up locally may not be an option. Thanks to the Golem Network, you can schedule an on-demand task on the providerâ€™s machine that will generate the audio for you and return the result, without a need to go through the aforementioned setup on your local machine. You can use this technique to execute any tasks when you want to offload your system, by changing the [GVMI image](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime/convert-a-docker-image-into-a-golem-image) and executing scripts.

### Description

Create a script that uses Golem to generate text-to-speech audio, allowing users to easily generate audio files without 
needing to install text-to-speech software locally. 

In this task, you will create a tool to convert text2speech. 
You will prepare the image that performs the task, write the short Node.js script that will request the tasks on the network and finally download the output. 
As input, the tool should accept text and the output should be an mp3 file downloaded to your system. 
We provide a dockerfile that contains espeak and is ready to be converted to a [GVMI image](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime/convert-a-docker-image-into-a-golem-image). 
Although, if you prefer to use any other tool than espeak, you are free to modify this dockerfile. 
Create a script that a Node.js interpreter executes and allows a user to provide text as input, which will be sent to 
a provider together with a payload containing installed tools for text2speech generation.
Once the generation is complete, an audio file is sent back to the user.

### Steps

1. Create a docker image from provided Dockerfile, convert it to a [GVMI](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime/convert-a-docker-image-into-a-golem-image) and publish the generated image to receive an image hash that will be used during the implementation
2. Modify the `main.mjs` script that will execute the text-2-speech conversion task and will be available under the `npm run tts` command ([Check our docs for introduction and examples](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/javascript/high-level/))
3. Run the script and verify the output 
4. Add changes in the `text-2-speech` directory
5. [Fill out the feedback form](./FEEDBACK.md) and publish changes in your repository fork
