Please provide any feedback you have regarding each task step below:

#### Step 1: Convert the docker image to a GVMI image and publish it to receive an image hash

For this task I have created a custom GVMI image using the [synesthesiam/marytts](https://hub.docker.com/r/synesthesiam/marytts) docker image which generates a near realistic voice from text. The image is public (**hash:** 24d5d1fd6666d22913eb0879c9a20d14619e225b74f94f4b13d5befc) and can be tested out. The process is fairly simple although I guess a lot of backend work is pretty sophisticated. I experienced no issue in this task.

#### Step 2: Modify a `main.mjs` script that will execute the text-2-speech conversion, available under the `npm run tts`

The documentation available at [https://docs.golem.network/creators](https://docs.golem.network/creators) has some good basic examples to illustrate power of Golem Network. However the true potential of Golem Network can only be harnessed if developers have ready references availabe of all the options in Golem Network in general and in JS Api in specific. I'd still emphasis the need and importance of good API documentation. The current API documentation available at [https://docs.golem.network/creators/javascript/docs/](https://docs.golem.network/creators/javascript/docs/) is very poorly structured. I wanted to implement something creative in this task but I had nowhere to look for good API reference.

## General feedback:

These days Developer Relations is a multiplying force in growth of any project / product. Golem Team should focus on Devrel for exposure to a wider developer audience. Social media plays a very critical role in this. I'd like to share a success story of a similar project here. Maybe you have heard of [**Prisma**](https://prisma.io), it's just an ORM. Now there are tens of ORMs out there, some are probably even more sophisticated than Prisma. However Prisma has skyrocketed in the JS World. The only reason they have been able to grow from **0** to **250K** active developers is great developer relations and community engagement. I suggest the team to just compare Youtube Channels of [**Prisma**](https://www.youtube.com/@PrismaData/videos) and [**Golem**](https://www.youtube.com/@GolemNetwork/videos) and see the difference for yourself.

### Suggestions for Improvement

Make the task a bit more challenging, within the doable limit.

Thank you for your feedback and for contributing to the Golem Network!
