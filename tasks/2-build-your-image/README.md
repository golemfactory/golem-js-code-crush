# Task #2 - Code Sandbox

Thank you for your interest in the JS Preview Program. Its purpose is to test the new JS API and the new documentation 
available at https://docs.golem.network/creators/. This is where you should find all the necessary information about 
Golem Network needed to complete this task. 

If you have any questions, we encourage you to contact the SDK team directly, who can help you identify any gaps 
in the documentation or fill in any gaps in your knowledge about the Golem Network platform - join our community on 
[Discord](https://chat.golem.network/) - find the `#js-discussion` channel in the SDK section. 

We also encourage you to visit https://www.golem.network/, where you can find more basic information about our open-source project.

## Task Details

### Why:

Golem allows you to schedule tasks with any payload. This includes GVMI image hash, where 
[GVMI is created from a Docker while a hash is obtained by publishing the GVMI to the Golem Image Repository.](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime/convert-a-docker-image-into-a-golem-image)
This hash (and hence the image) represents the execution environment for your tasks and services and is required by both 
dApps and JS/Python APIs. But since a hash is just a string, it’s possible to schedule tasks with JS API directly from 
the browser with any payload, unlocking a possibility e.g. to compile C++ and/or execute the binary file for results, 
still being in a browser context. It’s worth noting that you’re not restricted to images already existing in the Golem Repository. 
You can also prepare your own images to act as a sandbox for your experiments! 

### Description:

Build a web-based code sandbox that can execute code on the Golem Network, allowing users to compile and execute code directly from their web browser.

In this task, you will create a web page that will serve as a code sandbox for any language. You’ll also use Golem JS API in the browser to execute the code on the Golem Network. To start, you can use the provided node:16-alpine image but you should also create your own. Your system will support as many languages and as many images as you can prepare. Your tool should enable the user to paste the code, select a desired sandbox and run the core on a remote machine, finally providing the user with the execution output.

> **Warning**
> 
> For this task, you will need to install Yagna Daemon with a version of at least 0.13-rc2, so that you don’t have issues with CORS!
> 
> To install the daemon in this version, use the script below:
> 
> `$ curl -sSf https://join.golem.network/as-requestor | YA_INSTALLER_CORE=pre-rel-v0.13.0-rc2 bash -`
> 
> To start the daemon with CORS support, run the script below
> 
> `yagna service run --api-allow-origin='*'`

### Steps:

1. Convert the docker image to a [GVMI image](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime/convert-a-docker-image-into-a-golem-image) and publish it to receive an image hash
2. Create an HTML template with textarea for code input and a select element to choose a desired image hash to be used as an execution environment
3. Add a code in Golem JS API that takes the provided code and image hash to execute it on Golem Network and return execution output
4. Execution output is displayed to the user
5. [Fill out the feedback form](./FEEDBACK.md) and publish changes in your repository fork

**What is the Golem Network?**

We are building a new open-source world that everyone has the right to enter. 
The Golem Network is a flexible and open-source platform that harnesses the power of decentralization for 
accessing and sharing computational resources.

**Our new Golem JS Api lets you:**

- Develop distributed open-source computing solutions for a wide range of use cases
- Run tasks on the Golem Network directly from your browser
- Create serverless applications using Golem as your computation backend

With your feedback, our open-source platform, the Golem Network, will become even more attractive to other developers! 

**Thank you!**
