# Task #4 - Sending files

## Why

Golem JS SDK enables users to send files to Providers. 

In this challange, you will learn how to upload files.


## Task description

Creaet a tool which uses the Golem Network to host OCR conversion tools on your custom image. You can use the i.e. [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) engine to create your image.


### Steps

1. Create a your custom image.

2. Create a requestor script that will take the input image, send it to the provider, run the conversion, download the output as a file.

3. Add changes in the `build-your-image` directory.

4. [Fill out the feedback form](./FEEDBACK.md) and publish changes in your repository fork.

Create a Node.js script that uses Golem to perform image file conversions in parallel, allowing users to convert multiple images in different formats simultaneously.

First, create a Node.js script where a user can provide a path to the source image and choose the types of conversions he wants to perform. 
The script will spawn as many activities on providers as the number of conversions which were requested. 
It then executes the conversion script and sends the converted image back to the user as a result.

As an additional challenge, run the image conversion directly from the browser. 
Due to current limitations, file transfer is not yet available from the browser context, therefore image files need to be 
base64 converted, chunked, and sent as strings within the task, both as input and as a response

> **Warning**
> 
> For this task, you will need to install Yagna Daemon with a version of at least 0.13-rc2, so that you donâ€™t have issues with CORS!
> 
> To install the daemon in this version, use the script below:
> 
> `$ curl -sSf https://join.golem.network/as-requestor | YA_INSTALLER_CORE=pre-rel-v0.13.0-rc2 bash -`
> 
> To start the daemon with CORS support, run the script below
> 
> `yagna service run --api-allow-origin='*'`

### Steps:

1. Convert the docker image to a [GVMI image](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime/convert-a-docker-image-into-a-golem-image) and publish it to receive an image hash
2. Create a logic that schedules a task on Golem with image conversion, executed either from Node.js or browser context 
    - To start, follow this article as a reference - https://docs.golem.network/creators/javascript/examples/hello/
    - Use the `map` or `forEach` method of the `TaskExecutor`, pass n (n depending on the number of image formats) worker functions, each of which will execute the file conversion command on the provider. 
    - For node.js, use the transfer command to send the image file to the provider and receive the result from it. 
    - For the web browser, save to the file on the provider piece by piece the content of the image in base64 format and in the same way send it back to the browser
3. [Fill out the feedback form](./FEEDBACK.md) and publish changes in your repository fork

**What is the Golem Network?**

We are building a new open-source world that everyone has the right to enter. 
The Golem Network is a flexible and open-source platform that harnesses the power of decentralization for 
accessing and sharing computational resources.

**Our new Golem JS Api lets you:**

- Develop distributed open-source computing solutions for a wide range of use cases
- Run tasks on the Golem Network directly from your browser
- Create serverless applications using Golem as your computation backend

With your feedback, our open-source platform, the Golem Network, will become even more attractive to other developers! 

**Thank you!**
