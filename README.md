# Golem JS Preview Program

Welcome to the Golem JS Preview Program repository! 

Thank you for your interest in the JS Preview Program. Its purpose is to test the new JS API and the new documentation 
available at https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/javascript. 

This repository contains a set of tasks that you can complete to broaden your knowledge and help improve the Golem Network. 

If you have any questions, we encourage you to contact the SDK team directly, who can help you identify any gaps 
in the documentation or fill in any gaps in your knowledge about the Golem Network platform - join our community on 
[Discord](https://chat.golem.network/) - find the `#js-discussion` channel in the SDK section. 

We also encourage you to visit https://www.golem.network/, where you can find more basic information about our open-source project.

## Available Tasks

### [#0 - Yagna Setup (optional)](tasks%2F0-yagna-setup)
Install and configure the Yagna daemon on your machine to allow you to run tasks on the Golem Network.

### [Task #1 - Text2Speech](tasks%2F1-text-2-speech)
Create a script that uses Golem to generate text-to-speech audio, allowing users to easily generate audio files without needing to install text-to-speech software locally. 

**Guaranteed reward** for first 40 accepted submissions: **50$**

### [Task #2 - Code Sandbox](tasks%2F2-code-sandbox)
Build a web-based code sandbox that can execute code on the Golem Network, allowing users to compile and execute code directly from their web browser.

**Guaranteed reward** for first 40 accepted submissions: **60$**

### [Task #3 - Parallel File Conversion](tasks%2F3-parallel-file-conversion)
Create a Node.js script that uses Golem to perform image file conversions in parallel, allowing users to convert multiple images in different formats simultaneously.

**Guaranteed reward** for first 40 accepted submissions: **70$** (or **100$** if completed together with an additional challenge)

### [Task #4 - Text2Speech Server](tasks%2F4-text-2-speech-server)
Prepare for a bigger scale and allow any user to interact with your API. This will serve as a gateway that schedules tasks on Golem and forwards the results. 

**Guaranteed reward** for first 30 accepted submissions: **80$**

### [Task #5 - Best Provider Selection](tasks%2F5-best-provider-selection)
Create a Node.js script that selects the best provider to run a Golem task based on factors such as price, reliability, and performance.

## How to express interest in completing selected task(s) as part of the JS Preview Program?

1. Choose one platform through which we will settle your work - you decide which platform is more convenient for you:
  - Freelancer.com: [Task #1](#) | [Task #2](#) | [Task #3](#) | [Task #4](#) | [Task #5](#)
  - Upwork.com: [Task #1](#) | [Task #2](#) | [Task #3](#) | [Task #4](#) | [Task #5](#)
  - Fiverr.com: [Task #1](#) | [Task #2](#) | [Task #3](#) | [Task #4](#) | [Task #5](#)

2. Reply to a task brief on a selected platform and tell us a few words about your experience in JS development - we need to know you are the right person! Based on your experience, we will select testers to help us improve our JS API.
3. Once your application has been accepted, you can proceed with the task.

## How to report completing selected task(s)?

1. After completing all the steps outlined in **Task Details** section of each task, return to the selected billing platform (Freelancer / Upwork / Fiverr) and, in response to the task, send your **GitHub username** and the **email address** provided in the GitHub submission form.
2. Next, an SDK department employee will verify your task(s). We will reject feedback such as "Ok." or "Cool." We value honest and helpful feedback, which is the goal of this program.
3. How do we determine if feedback is valid? We seek feedback that has a groundbreaking nature or has a potential impact on the Golem platform. For example, it can include the most challenging issue (technical or functional) you faced during the implementation of the particular task(s) and the steps you took to solve it.
4. Once your feedback is approved, we will make a payment.

## How will we distribute over $2500 in additional funds to creators of the most valuable feedback?

We're interested in hearing about any difficult obstacles you encountered and how you overcame them with your creativity 
and resourcefulness. So, let's hear all the juicy details to help make Golem even more amazing. 

The authors of the most valuable feedback will receive even more money, with a **prize pool of over $2500 up for grabs**.

And remember - if you want to simply earn more, just do more tasks!

**What is the Golem Network?**

We are building a new open-source world that everyone has the right to enter. 
The Golem Network is a flexible and open-source platform that harnesses the power of decentralization for 
accessing and sharing computational resources.

**Our new Golem JS Api lets you:**

- Develop distributed open-source computing solutions for a wide range of use cases
- Run tasks on the Golem Network directly from your browser
- Create serverless applications using Golem as your computation backend

With your feedback, our open-source platform, the Golem Network, will become even more attractive to other developers! 

**Thank you!**
